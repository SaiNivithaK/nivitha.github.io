### About me
Hi there! I’m Nivitha, a product manager with a knack for turning ideas into impactful products. I bring a diverse background—an ECE grad from SASTRA University, a developer at TCS working on flagship healthcare projects, and now part of Jio Edge Cloud, crafting cloud-native solutions.
I thrive on solving problems, digitizing experiences, and driving cross-functional teams. From streamlining claims to designing SaaS journeys, I love making things efficient and user-centric. Let’s connect if you're looking for someone passionate about learning, growth, and delivering value!
